    <h1>The struggles of Our Life</h1>
    <p class="text-justify margin-left: 20px;"><a href="#">December 14 2020</a> posted by Maica Dela Torre in <a href="#">Inspirational strories</a> </p>
    <p>Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable<br>
       and that she didn't know how she was going to make it. She was tired of fighting<br>
       and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one<br>
       soon followed. Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He fiiled three pots with<br>
        water and placed each on a high fire.</p>
    <p>Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second<br>
       pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot. He then let them sit and boil, without<br>
       saying a word to his daughter. The daughter, moaned and impatiently waited, wondering<br> 
       what he was doing. After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes<br>
       out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup.<br>
    <p>Turning to her, he asked. <strong>"Daughter, what do you see?"</strong>she hastily replied.<br>
    <strong>"Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,"</strong><br>
    <strong>"Look closer"</strong> he said,<strong>"and touch the potatoes."</strong> She did and noted that they were soft.<br>
    He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed <br>
    that hard-boiled egg.<br>
    <p>Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face.<br>
    <strong>"Father, what does this mean?"</strong> she asked.<br>
    <p>He then explained that the potatoes, the egg and the coffee beans had each faced the<br>
       same adversity-the boiling water. However, each one reacted differently. The potato went<br>
      in strong, hard and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak.</p>
    <p>The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was<br>
       put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard.<br>
    However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water,<br>
     they changed the water and created something new.</p>
    <p><strong>"Which one are you?"</strong> he asked his daughter.</p>
    <p class="text-left"><strong>"When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond?<br>
       Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean?"</strong></p>

          <p>In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that<br>
            truly matters is how you choose to react to it and what you make out of it.<br>
            Life is all about learning, adopting and converting all the struggles that we<br>
             experience into something.</p>
